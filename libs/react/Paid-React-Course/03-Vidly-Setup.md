## Vidly Project (Components 15)

Started this on my mac, installed create-react-app, had to do the following:

```
sudo npm cache clean --force
```
This one didn't work:

```
sudo npm cache verify
```
then install create-react-app:

```
npm install -g create-react-app
```
Installed following packages:

```
npm i bootstrap@4.1.1 font-awesome@4.7.0
```

Import those two css files in index.js, and get rid of default react logo stuff.
